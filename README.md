## Files

Each color has 2 watchface files:

1. Static VaultGirl + Animation decently dressed
2. Animation with a neckline + Animation pants + suspenders

This is due to a heavy files, Mi Band can not handle too many animations. You can select desired animation style 
with watchface settings, and you can install all of them!

*Note: All these clock-faces were tested on Mi Band 9 Pro, but they should work on Mi Band 8 Pro as well.*

## How to Install

I was using [Notify for Mi Band & Xiaomi](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mc.xiaomi1&hl=en),
but there are other ways too.

Here a short instruction:

0. Tested on Galaxy S25, Mi Band 9 Pro
1. If you have Mi Fitness (official app) installed:
- Long press on App's icon 
- Open settings 
- Turn "Nearby Devices" off 
- Close Mi Fitness
2. Install Notify for Mi Band & Xiaomi (orange one, blue one for older Mi Band versions)
3. Do what it wants, save your pair-key, don't sync data to Notify for Mi Band & Xiaomi
4. Go directly to watchfaces tab, install one-by-one all watchfaces you want:
- Use install custom from .bin, it works fine with .face files 
- Install one by one, then open watchface to check if installed successfully, reinstall if needed 
- In my case Mi Band was occasionally freezing for a minute or so, then restarted itself 
- To avoid freezes – give it a time! Mi Band reads each installed WatchFace to obtain preview, which takes a second
5. Notify for Mi Band & Xiaomi don't provide weather, so uninstall it after you done
6. Allow Mi Fitness (official app) to use "Nearby Devices"
7. Sync data with Mi Fitness
8. Done!


## How to modify these watchface?

I was using MiCreate on Windows 11, I ttok it from here, it is .exe:

https://4pda.to/forum/index.php?showtopic=1076706&st=740#entry135696472

[Same file in this repo](MiCreate.exe)

It needs to be installed. I was not able to open watchface-project files with 
[EasyFace](https://github.com/m0tral/EasyFace), seems like these 2 apps does not support each other's files.

You can find source files for each watchface in this repo, including images:

[watchfaces](watchfaces_src)

[images](media_src)

**IMPORTANT** This exact version of MiCreate can only build for MiBand 8 pro for some reason. But, it works just fine
with pro 9, so build for Pro 8. Or use any other software

### Recommendations

- Use this wiki as an instruction for MiCreate: https://github.com/m0tral/EasyFace (same for MiCreate and EasyFace)
- I was only able to build 2 color into a single file
- With more than 2 WatchFace Mi Band can not install a file (probably due file size)
- To pack several watchfaces into a single file, create 2 project files (.fprj) in the same folder and build from MiCreate using any of them
- You need to have a folder 'images' with all media, used for a watchface, right next to project file (.fprj)
- You must have a file example.png in images folder, it should be 336x480 to build a watchface
- MiCreate is full of bugs
- Save all you data by literally copying project file to another folder
- In case of any error message, there is 50/50 chance that your current project-file is corrupted, no matter what you do next
- No, saving project with "save" button will not help – save project file to another place, when you sure it's buildable


### Changing color

If you familiar with Python, you can change color [with this](python_tools/color_changer.py)
[Get convertable images from here](media_src/CONVERTABLE_IMAGES/AUTOMATIC) all there images can be converted with that
script. [These images](media_src/CONVERTABLE_IMAGES/COMMON) can typically stay the same for any watchface color.
[And these image](media_src/CONVERTABLE_IMAGES/MANUAL) need to be converted manually using photoshop or similar tool.

[These 3 folders](media_src/CONVERTABLE_IMAGES) are all the images used for each of my watchfaces. After converting them
to a color you like, place them in a folder images [for any watchface in here](watchfaces_src) and open any of the
project file, for example [this one](watchfaces_src/PipGirlProject/PipGirlProject_d.fprj). It will automatically 
apply your images with new color. Now you can build new watchface using MiCrate.

Note, that you will also need to change Watchface ID under 'File' -> 'Manage project'. Each watchface should have 
unique name, or it will replace already installed one with the same ID.

## FAQ

> **Does this watchface drains battery any faster?** 
> > Testing is in progress. It looks like animated versions have some effect. Will update in several weeks

> **Why so many colors?**
> > I have ordered a bunch of different straps for Mi Band, something like 15, and trying to match a color of 
> > watchface to each strap. So there probably would be more colors as more and more straps arriving)

## Known issues

Sometimes MiBand copies animation (VaultGirl) into 5 - 10 instances, spreading them across the screen. In this case
open Watchface settings, swipe up-down to other animation version and set watchface again.

After first installation preview on MiBand is taken from Watchfaces' files. It looks a bit different from actual
watchface. MiBand resets preview after opening settings for concrete watchface and keeps it right after that.

Weather icons are not completely tested. Icons are set after 'weather index', and there a lots of them. I was not
able to find any complete description, so took some other watchface and copied its indices. There might be an issue
with weather icon, when it would display NOT the actual weather. I am currently collecting indices with their 
descriptions to see, if any are wrong. In static of Cian watchface 
[in here](watchfaces_src/PipGirlProject/Extra/output/Cian_VaultGirl_v10_1.face) watchface displays actual index it reads
from weather provider. This is how I keep track and compare indices. Collection them all might take a while) 
Here what I currently have:

- 004 – [Thunder + rain]
- 001 – [Partly cloudy]
- 008 – [Moderate rain]
- 000 – [Clear]

I was not able to create a button for Oxygen. No idea why and how to do that.

There might be an issue with weather alerts for negative temperatures – did not test yet, waiting for winter)

No idea what would happen in case IV-index goes above 10. MiCreate crashes if trying to set a value for UV=11 or 
higher. Probably the bar will just stick to its upper limit, so should be ok.
